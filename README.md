Odin Project..project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-shopping-cart

Project was to create a simple shopping cart/store with React.

Tools used:
- React (HTML, CSS, JS, JSX)
- React Router
- Git

Bugs
- when closing cart, it takes you back to top of page because its relative to the body not the header
- no x button when clicking on product (to do ðŸ‘€)
